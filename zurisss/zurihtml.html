            <p>“My name is Hadiza and I am a student of Unilag, 
                currently studying Law. 
                 I am also in my final year. 
                 <br>I like swimming, sleeping, reading novels e.t.c, 
                 My goal is to be a proffessional Front-end developer. 
                I am currently taking this training to fulfil my goal.
                <br> I am an interesting, fun loving girl with a good sense of humor.
                <br> One thing about me that is important to know though is that at first I come of as a very shy individualistic guy but once I get to know people and are comfortable with my environment I am great. 
                <br>  It is hard for me to make friends but once I make them, it’s great and I am all different. 
                <br> I joke, laugh and humor people and I also get as much as I give. 
                 I am a very kind, compassionate, sensitive girl as my close friends will tell you. 
                 <br> I am also a very principled person and stand strong on what is right and wrong. I am also a very straight and honest person.
                <br> I understand and know that we all put on a show sometimes and do not show who we really are or what we feel but some people do this constantly and those kinds of people I cannot stand.
